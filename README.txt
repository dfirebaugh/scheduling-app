Submitted: 5/20/2022

## Purpose
This is a GUI application that will help facilitate scheduling of appointments.

### Author
This applicatioon was written by Dustin Firebaugh - dfireba@my.wgu.edu


### Development Environment and requirements
IDE: IntelliJ Community 2020.01
JDK: Java SE 17.0.1
JAVAFX: javafx-sdk-17.0.1
MYSQLCONNECTOR: mysql-connector-java-8.0.25

### Running the app
The code includes a configuration for IntelliJ to run the app.
If you open this directory in IntelliJ, it should see this configuration.  You can then run the configuration from within IntelliJ (or press shift+enter)

> Note: the configuration does assume that the `javafx` library is downloaded to a specific directory on the machine (e.g. `$USER_HOME$/Desktop/javafx-sdk-17.0.1\` -- this should match the configuration of the lab environment)

### Additional report
The additional report added lists all appointments by Customer ID.
